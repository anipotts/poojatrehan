March 8, 2025, Matthew was Pooja’s teacherMarch 8, 2025, Matthew was Pooja’s teacher
I know Pooja because she was a student in CS 0002, Introduction to Computer Programming in Python, which I taught in Fall 2023 at NYU. She worked hard in my class and was very dedicated to learning the material and she learned a lot. 

She is working hard at NYU and doing well. She has developed strong problem solving skills and has learned to approach problems creatively and logically. She works well with others and has strong communicationskills. She is resilient in the face of difficulties and has been able to overcome challenges to acquire new skills and learn new ideas. She is also organized and timely in her work.

I believe that Pooja would be an asset to any organization or academic program, and
therefore I am happy to recommend her for any position or for any further schooling.I know Pooja because she was a student in CS 0002, Introduction to Computer Programming in Python, which I taught in Fall 2023 at NYU.

Hi Anirudh,

Hope you’re well?

Thanks for connecting a few days ago – I thought I’d pop up and say hello!

How’s your week so far?

Hi Anirudh, how are you doing? I came across your profile and saw that just like me you're an NYU grad and an engineer. I just checked out your experience, any chance I could ask you a quick question? :)
